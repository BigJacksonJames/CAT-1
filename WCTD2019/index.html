        <p>The 1956 Winter Olympics, officially known as the VII Olympic Winter Games (French: Les VIIes Jeux
            olympiques d'hiver) (Italian: VII Giochi olimpici invernali), was a <a href="https://www.google.com">multi-sport</a>
            event celebrated in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, from 26 January to 5 February 1956.</p>

        <p>Cortina, which had originally been awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics, beat out Montreal, Colorado Springs and
            Lake Placid for the right to host the 1956 Games. The Cortina Games were unique in that many of the venues
            were within walking distance of each other. The organising committee received financial support from the
            Italian government for infrastructure improvements, but the rest of the costs for the Games had to be
            privately financed. Consequently, the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on corporate
            sponsorship for funding.[1] </p>
